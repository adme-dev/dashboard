# Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

## Working Agreements
- Maintain Memory Bank as source of truth; update after significant changes.
- Prefer server routes for Xero API interactions; never expose secrets client-side.
- Optimize for clarity and skimmability in UI and docs.

## Patterns & Preferences
- Use composables: `useXeroAuth`, `useXeroData`, `useAI` for separation of concerns.
- Charts and widgets should receive normalized, typed data from server endpoints.
- Cache-first reads; invalidate on webhook events or after scheduled sync.

## Tooling
- Package manager: pnpm
- Linting: follow repo eslint config; no unused vars/any leaks.

## Open Implementation Notes
- Choose minimal persistence (SQLite/Prisma) for rapid Phase 1; plan Postgres.
- Decide `xero-node` vs REST; REST may reduce dependency surface and improve control.
