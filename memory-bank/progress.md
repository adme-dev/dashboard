# Progress

## What Works
- Nuxt UI Dashboard template present and ready
- Project documentation (Memory Bank) initialized from PRD

## In Progress
- Define DB and caching approach for token storage and sync metadata
- Plan Phase 1 implementation tasks

## Next Up
- Implement Xero OAuth 2.0 (server routes + secure storage)
- Build KPI cards with live data plumbing
- Add P&L and Balance Sheet report endpoints and pages

## Known Issues/Risks
- No persistence layer yet for tokens and sync state
- Rate limits require careful batching and caching strategy
