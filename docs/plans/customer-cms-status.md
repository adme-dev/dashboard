# Customer CMS and Studio — current checklist

Last updated: 1 October 2026. Start here after an interruption.
This checklist tracks the active standalone CMS work; it does not declare the
entire platform or hosted rollout complete. Detailed decisions and acceptance:
[Form settings completion](2026-10-01-form-settings-completion.md),
[Fantasy Limo demo](2026-10-01-fantasy-limo-demo.md),
[standalone style guide](../design/standalone-cms-style-guide.md).

## Completed and verified locally

- [x] Fantasy Limo standalone customer dashboard using its existing saved site.
- [x] Normal customer sign-in and scoped site membership for the invited-customer demo.
- [x] Overview and saved Pages & SEO browser (75 pages).
- [x] Searchable media library with authenticated image previews (109 assets).
- [x] Separate Forms configuration and Enquiries inbox navigation.
- [x] Shared form definitions and explicit adoption: four forms, eight placements;
      Booking enquiry is one form used on five pages.
- [x] Shared-identity enforcement for typed manual/AI form operations in Studio.
- [x] Draft confirmation messages and conditional same-site redirects, with simulation.
- [x] Customer-owned, revisioned outcome drafts and stale-save protection.
- [x] Website-wide team recipient drafts and shared-form overrides, including
      inheritance impact, effective addresses and explicit obsolete-override cleanup.
- [x] Browser validation of recipient saves, override preservation, conflicts,
      discard/reload, in-app navigation protection and mobile layout.
- [x] Durable local demo files, database/media copies, backup and restart instructions.
- [x] Relevant marketing descriptions updated with explicit local-preview limits.

## In progress now

- [ ] **Admin/team and customer email template drafts.** Inspect/adapt the existing
      structured email editor/rendering core; implement customer-scoped drafts,
      approved variables and safe previews with synthetic answers.
      Current state: source inspection only; no template implementation committed.

## Remaining form and email work

- [ ] Website template defaults and explicit per-form template overrides.
- [ ] Visual structured template editing, subject/preheader, brand styling,
      desktop/mobile preview and draft revision history.
- [ ] AI template proposals through the existing gateway/credit conventions;
      validate output and require Apply; preserve manual edits.
- [ ] Verified sender/reply-to and customer email-field selection.
- [ ] Approved notification outbox: idempotency, suppression, bounded retries,
      redacted delivery history, explicit test sends and delivery activation.
- [ ] Publish approved outcome revisions; redirect only after durable acceptance.
- [ ] Customer-owned webhook connections, mapping, signatures and retry controls.
- [ ] Converge the legacy enquiry inbox onto customer-owned submission storage.
- [ ] Inquiry assignments/notes, export, retention and operational metrics.
- [ ] Customer-facing reuse/new-form controls and explicit detach/undo.
- [ ] Managed hosted schema/runtime upgrades and safe adoption rollout.

## Wider CMS journey still requiring acceptance

- [ ] Native sign-up → customer creation/provisioning → standalone dashboard
      acceptance (distinct from the working invited-customer demo).
- [ ] Standalone editor launch, editing, save/reload and release acceptance.
- [ ] Connected customer content collections/blog/gallery workflows in this demo.
- [ ] Customer invitations/roles and membership/subscription standards end-to-end.
- [ ] Custom domain and production launch journey.
- [ ] Analytics/SEO operations beyond the saved-page inspection already present.

These wider items may have foundations elsewhere; unchecked means not accepted
end-to-end in this standalone demo, not necessarily zero code exists.

## Resume information

- Dashboard: `/Users/paulgiurin/Documents/Projects/customer-cms-development`
  (`dashboard/.worktrees/customer-cms` is a symlink).
  Branch `feat/standalone-site-workspace`; last implementation `6713dbb0d`.
- Studio: `/Users/paulgiurin/Documents/Projects/customer-cms-studio`
  (`dashboard/.worktrees/studio-customer-forms` is a symlink).
  Branch `feat/customer-form-settings-drafts`; last implementation `8b7516a`.
- Both feature branches are pushed. Fetch and check divergence before continuing;
  do not implement in the unrelated dirty Dashboard root or deploy a stale branch.
- Demo: `/Users/paulgiurin/Documents/Projects/customer-cms-demo/README.md`.
  Restart with that directory's `start.sh`; do not start a second server on port 3044.
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3044/studio/sites/c34f6347-cc63-4ed7-9a5a-da165ebefed2`.
- Latest local backup: `customer-cms-demo/private/backups/2026-10-01T05-20-43.918Z/`.
  Preserve the private directory and media; do not commit credentials or copied data.
- Recipient sample revision 4: `office@example.test`, with Contact override
  `contact@example.test`. These are inert demo addresses, not approved recipients.

## Verification and boundaries

Recipient slice: 50 focused tests and browser checks pass. Studio build (28 tasks),
typecheck (44 plus security types), package tests (40 tasks), action runtime (48)
and full formatting (1,517 files) pass. Known broader failures: Dashboard typecheck
has 934 existing diagnostics, none in the changed slice; Studio security has one
pre-existing staging route-count assertion failure (35 pass).

No merge/deployment or email delivery enabled for these local slices. Hosted
schema activation, published outcomes and the template builder remain pending.
Unsaved in-app navigation is protected; hard browser refresh/close still discards
unsaved edits, and the UI asks the user to save first.

## Update rule

At each completed slice, tick only verified work, record the implementation
commits and acceptance evidence, and name the next concrete step. Before stopping
mid-slice, replace the In progress note with exact partial changes and blockers.
